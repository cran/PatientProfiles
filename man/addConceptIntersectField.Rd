\title{It adds a custom column (field) from the intersection with a certain table
subsetted by concept id. In general it is used to add the first value of a
certain measurement.}
\usage{
addConceptIntersectField(
  x,
  conceptSet,
  field,
  indexDate = "cohort_start_date",
  censorDate = NULL,
  window = list(c(0, Inf)),
  targetDate = "event_start_date",
  order = "first",
  inObservation = TRUE,
  allowDuplicates = FALSE,
  nameStyle = "{field}_{concept_name}_{window_name}",
  name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Table with individuals in the cdm.}

\item{conceptSet}{Concept set list.}

\item{field}{Column in the standard omop table that you want to add.}

\item{indexDate}{Variable in x that contains the date to compute the
intersection.}

\item{censorDate}{Whether to censor overlap events at a date column of x}

\item{window}{Window to consider events in.}

\item{targetDate}{Event date to use for the intersection.}

\item{order}{'last' or 'first' to refer to which event consider if multiple
events are present in the same window.}

\item{inObservation}{If TRUE only records inside an observation period
will be considered.}

\item{allowDuplicates}{Whether to allow multiple records with same
conceptSet, person_id and targetDate. If switched to TRUE, the created new
columns (field) will be collapsed to a character vector separated by `;` to
account for multiple values per person.}

\item{nameStyle}{naming of the added column or columns, should include
required parameters.}

\item{name}{Name of the new table, if NULL a temporary table is returned.}
}
\value{
Table with the `field` value obtained from the intersection
}
\description{
It adds a custom column (field) from the intersection with a certain table
subsetted by concept id. In general it is used to add the first value of a
certain measurement.
